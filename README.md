EnvironmentControllerKata
=========================

What is the best way to design a test that needs to check several things about the state of the system? This example is a part of an environmental control system. One test should check that when the temperature is very cold, the alarm, header, and blower are all turned on. There are other tests which check the state of the system in other conditions.

Look at all the example test cases and decide which design you find easiest to understand and work with.
